Personal Website Planning Sheet

TODO
------------------------
	Add way to navigate site (a bar like old threads to go back to previous sections)
	Come up with better way to organize notes and project
		I think there should be a better divide between project section (more about nitty gritty and in depth (get really granular)) and the note section (more one off ideas maybe don't need whole sections dedicated to them)
