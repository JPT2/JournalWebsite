Notes from GEB
Canon - A musical form of playing a song against itself. The manner in which this is accomplished can vary, but canon's tend to be isomorphisms (they preserve the original information after transformation).
Fugue - A musical form where "voices" (perhaps read as themes or melodies) enter the song one by one and wait for the others while performing a countersubject.
Strange Loop - Moving up or down in the environment ultimately lands you back where you started.
