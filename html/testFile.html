      {title: "Ject: A Project Journal", date:  "8/30/2019", content: "What do I want this website to be and why am I pursing it? Honestly at this point in time I can only hazily see what it is I want this project to be - a cross between a trophy case and a notebook. More than that, I want something that can be grandiose or intimate. I basically have two projects that I'm trying to forcibly beat into submission to create some type of Frankenstein monster. However, I can faintly see how these ideas might be married together in a more elegant fashion. The idea of a polished exterior with a rough and tumble inner working hiding underneath the surface is exactly what I think I want, and it's something I'm both excited and scared of pursuing. If I'm going to work on something I want it to be great. The issue is I know I want to work on this, I just don't know exactly what this is, and that is a bit paralyzing, If I don't know, don't even have a clear vision of the end result, how can I guarantee that it'll be perfect? However, at the same time I think that just might be the point of this project. To explore and mess around with uncertainty to see just what might happen. After all, its not like I've been up to much lately...", parent: 0},
      {title: null, date: "8/30/2019", content: "Going into this project I'm not really sure what to expect. But like I said last time, maybe that is the point. Nonetheless if I'm going to approach this blank canvas I want to learn something through this process. I want to come out the other end with some clear lessons learned so at least it won't be so terrifying next time. I'm trying a couple of experiments with this project and I'm curious to see how they play out. The first one is something I think is pretty common place (but I'm not really sure), and that's the idea of \"bolting things down\". It's an idea that got brought to my attention after working on a project with a small team. The idea specifically is just \"identifying one simple thing you want to do and finding a straightforward way of doing it\". This is something I actually really struggle with. It seems whenever I let my imagination loose I fall into a habit of \"prematurely optimizing\" - thinking of all sort of increasingly complex and nuanced ways of approaching the problem (although often times these approaches might miss the point of the problem entirely). I think this form of thought process, the idea explosion, can have its place, but that place is not in a vacuum. Without a tether to reality its far too easy to spin your ideation wheels (which while fun, gets you nowhere). Its only when you have a firm goal, a clear measure, that you can actually make headway. Thus, maybe the idea I'm trying to articulate here is the notion of chunking. For me, in this context, that just means making specific what your goals are, delineating in a concrete way what it is you want to do, and then drilling down as far or as wide as you need to go to get some actionable steps. This idea plays nicely with the second experiment I want to run with this project, something I call atomic design. Atomic design as I'll define it is kind of the complement process to chunking. It is my recipe for creating complexity simply - a recent theme in my life that I find fascinating (inspired in some part by GEB (check my books read), fractals, atomic physics, and neuroscience). All this is just a long-winded and winding way of saying that atomic design is the idea of identifying simple fundamental parts (atoms) that you then use and combine with each other to produce complex and interesting behavior. For those who are into computer science, atomic design might be something akin to OOP (maybe just a little more philosophical in a sense). Anyways, I'm excited to experiment with these design philosophies I've randomly concocted and see where they lead me. ---As a disclaimer, if these design principles or ways of thinking exist in some other form or under some other name I don't mean to claim them as my own. I'm woefully ignorant of literature or common practices and I just wanted to try thing my way (and this was the way I randomly decided on).", parent: null},
      {title: null, date: "8/30/2019", content: "So with those philosophies stated I should probably actually start getting into the meat of what the hell this website is all about, what I'm thinking of doing to develop it, what the \"chunks\" and \"atoms\" I've identified are, and how I plan on developing all this (especially because I'm only giving myself a month to do this... (Although perhaps I should say I'm not sure if that is a long time or a short time for something like this, but, hey, I'll learn)). So without further ado...", parent: null},
      {title: "What is this website about?", date: "8/30/2019", content: "What is this website about?: Well that is actually an excellent question that I'm not really sure I believe I have an answer to yet... All I can say is I'm infatuated with the idea of making this into a \"project notebook\". Now saying that doesn't really get me anywhere closer to answering the question, it just shifts the perspective (but, hey, it makes me feel like I have some better idea of what I want). The question then becomes what the hell a \"project notebook\" is - what does that really mean? Using the same ideas I quoted in my first little note on this process, I think the project notebook is what constitutes that gooey center behind the (hopefully) polished veneer of a finished project. That is, its a way of detailing the creative journey/adventure behind bringing a project to life. Ultimately I think this site will be a \"trophy case\" of sorts, a collection of projects that I'm happy to show off. However, I think this site will also house the collection of stories and adventures behind them. Inside of each trophy case will be the tale of the false starts, the wrong turns, and (hopefully) the triumphs that led to that project's completion. I want this website to capture the mindsets and lessons learned for each project if for no other reason than because I think it might help me learn how to build the next one better. This vision doesn't do much to really answer the hard question of what exactly this means in terms of implementation specifics, but it at least gives me a direction to move in. Coming from operating in an idea vacuum, I think that might just be the best I can ask for right now.", parent: 2},
      {title: "\"The Chunks\"", date: "8/30/2019", content: "This is really my first attempt at addressing the \"hard\" implementation parts. As much as I feel nailing down the direction I want to move in was difficult, this next step of identifying what specifically it is that realizes that vision is seemingly more so. I think this is mostly due to the \"vision\" not really having what could seem to be a wrong answer, while the implementation seems, if only because its one step more concrete, seems like there are infinite places to go wrong. Now that I've properly entertained that diversion I should probably actually confront the problem (you can see how much I try to avoid it...). So at this stage of the project (basically the stone age) I can say that I've identified very rough chunks to solve the problem of capturing a \"creative journey\". Those chunks are 1.) The showcase, and 2.) Community. The showcase is the chunk that for me describes the trophy case and journal (The next two chunks). The journal then is a collection of notes (which I'm heavily leaning towards having interwoven (I'm still poisoned by the thread's thought process...)) and those notes a collection of content (at here I kind of hit a wall for now). The community is what I like to think of as the interactive side of the site. What good would it be to put myself out there if I wasn't getting anything out of it ;)? The community part is the inclusion of a \"current affairs\" section which tracks what I'm currently up to, and a feedback section which lets people voice their opinions and influence my creative process (It's probably pretty optimistic to think that people would actually interact with my ideas, I'm not even sure people will want to look at them). Developing a way of getting a different perspective and starting a conversation about the things I'm working on seems both fascinating and rewarding (at least for me...) (now I've just got to find a way to get other people to think the same way...).", parent: 2},
      {title: "\"The Atoms\"", date: "8/30/2019", content: "This is strongly coupled with the chunks identified above, it's just ever so slightly distinct enough to differentiate (and I already committed to making this a section...). The core component of this site, the atom on which everything is based on, is the note. Projects, which comprise the contents of the showcases, which in turn comprises the contents of the site, are in my current vision just containers of nicely wrapped notes that cleanly present the story of that specific project. Everything on this site will in one way or another probably be some kind of note. Those notes might be packaged, wrapped, or dressed in certain ways, but at the core level notes they will remain. Now while notes might seem like the atom for the site, unfortunately for me, notes are not in themselves atomic - I need to find the \"quarks\" that comprise them. It here at this \"subatomic\" level that I hit the wall again. As far as I can say right now, notes will be comprised of \"content\", but this is basically another way of saying I don't know what should comprise them. It is here that I'm currently mired, and hoping that soon some divine inspiration will come to me.", parent: 2},
      {title: null, date: "9/1/2019", content: "I've reached a strange cross roads in the project. It seems I'm building a blog. It might seem obvious to those reading now, but for the longest time I thought, maybe hoped, I was building something different. It hit me while I was writing ideas out in my notebook about what this site needs to do that really all I'm doing is building a project themed blog. Now that isn't really a bad thing by any means, but I think I wanted to believe that this was going to be something beyond that (and maybe it still can be). However, when I delineated what I thought this website should be ( 1) A tool for helping me to work and develop new projects, 2) A tool for helping me learn and evaluate my thought process behind projects) I realized that simple blog posts largely accomplish both these goals.", parent: null},
      {title: null, date: "9/1/2019", content: "Re-contextualizing this project as a creating a blog I think I'm finally starting to get over some of my old bad habits. Perhaps one reason it took so long to get to the simple conclusion that this project is just a blog is that I was still prematurely optimizing and imagining what this project could turn into somewhere down the road. Saying that this site is a blog doesn't magically solve my problem, it just gives me a base from which to build and approach the problem from. It is possible that another approach may be better suited to this project, and maybe eventually I'll discover it, but in terms of applying my experimental philosophy of chunking and doing the simple things first before the complicated, I think that pursuing this as a blog and then figuring out where the shortcomings are will be much more fruitful. I've never really interacted with blogs so this is still green pastures for me (and perhaps trying to design a replacement for something you no nothing about is ill founded anyways). One thing I've also noticed is that I use this website currently more as a place to dump my mind after doing some thinking instead of using it as a place to do the thinking itself. Maybe that might be on of the areas in which the blog fails to deliver and will require me to redesign in the future...", parent: null},
      {title: null, date: "9/1/2019", content: "I spent a little time thinking about why this is being used more as a retrospective journal rather than a notebook and a few things came to mind. 1.) The speed of transmission between ideas in my head to typed words is a bit slow for me, 2.) the publishing aspect and context of it all makes it seem like it needs to be a bit more formal, 3.) the tools don't really easily allow for rapid iteration of ideas and for working on partial thoughts (everything seems like it needs to be fully thought out), 4.) much more liberating to write/draw (have more control over the space and can put little notes wherever I want (but I can't see an obvious place for that in the context of the \"blog\")).", parent: null},
