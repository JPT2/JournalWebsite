Introduction
Brain Machine Interface (BMI) early use case includes a wide range of clinical disorders. 
Justification for tech is seen in existing use for neuroprosthetics (robot control, speech synthesizers, etc.).

Big limiting factor on the tech is in the low resolution of the sampling technology. Question is then raised of what issues currently stand in the way of implementation and if solved would make something like the Neuralink possible.

Identified as issues are 
	Low resolution - Inability to record from large amount of neurons.
	Low precision - Inability to record with precision (currently invasive strategies average over their sample)
	Shallowness of sample - Inability to access signals deep in the brain.
Ideally a solution that provides large-scale recordings would have following properties
	Longevity/Durability - Ideally would set up once and be done so as not to constantly be disturbing the brain ()
	Biocompatability - Will be hard to continue to harvest information if the brain rejects the device.
	Safety - Longer life means more data.
	High Density - Need high fidelity information to make readings worth while.
	Low-Power - I could see how this would be necessary due to the device living in someone's head but i'm not sure if its truly necessary.

Current Technology for long-term neural recordings are arrays of electrodes ade from rigid metals or semiconductors. (Seems these types of devicecs tend to be larger and trigger immune responses which makes it less effective)

Have to remember that we're dealing with a biological system that tends to be adverse to external stimulus (this is why biocomptability is so important).

Having a rigid system also constrains what type of manuvers can be done and seemingly what types of neurons can be reached (while have to look into this more).

How does vasculature limit the interface (and on that note what other limitng factors are in place (is there a max voltage? What does the "interface" look like?))

Multi-electrode polymer probes
	Advantages - 
		Smaller size
		Increased flexibility -

Neuralink Approach
	Three main components
		Ultra-fine polymer probes (Device)
		Neurosurgical robot (Implanting)
		Custom high-density electronics (for streaming electrophysiology data from all electrodes)
	How its realized
		Film array composed of thread (where electrode contacts are stored and traces?) and sensor (transfers data collected) 
		Threads - component material of the film interface which realizes the device. 

	Questions
		Does this device have two way communication? Seems like it only pulls information from the brain.
